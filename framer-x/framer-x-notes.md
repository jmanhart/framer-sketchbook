### Thoughts:
- Preview changes to whatever acgtive artboard you are on. I wish there was a "lock" options to keep it from shifting/changing as I switch between artboards in the canvas.
- The distribute, Align, gap attributes on the scroll and stack components was not obvious that it related to Flex properties. I am familiar with these flex attributes but to someone with zero knowledge of flex it could be very confusing. Maybe a great oppurtunity to educate.
- Can I not make a design component from a Text Layer? I get a strange "cannot complete" button prompt. Must it be wrapped in a frame?
- I kept returning to the + icon to create a new component
- I wish there was a way to view source on Packages. I would like to see the source react code. Somthing similar to like a pull request?
- Wish there was a Create new component asepect/prompt in the + portion of the tool. Feels like it would fit perfectly at the bottom of the side menu where is live in the "Component manager" tab.
- I wish I could change properties on the linking arrows between screens and components.
- Some sort of basic console would be nice. I used this a lot when testing/de-bugging
- Path - Rotations the arrows I have zero clue what those are actually doing
- Pathfinder tool - Maybe a little too minimal. This is something I hated with adobe. I never really know what is going to happen its always trial and error.
- Stroke - Dashed line. Array is not very easy to understand if you have zero coding experience. Not full customization on that attribute either.
- Shadow spread not working?
- Properties on the Shadows is very minimal and might not be intuative to new users/non adobe sketch people.
- Star item - Select, Tap enter, makes it selectable, make no change, still stays as a path. Not sure this is possible to maintain the shape properties.
- Bounding Box on polygons is not to edge without having to "expand" the shape (tapping enter into the shape)
- Polygon - Is a slider really useful with choosing sides? I get it for radius but something like sides seems just strange.
- Polygon - Shape object radius WYSIWYG. Would be cool if each corner had its on node to change border radius. And not just one that controls all.
- Text - Would be nice to have recently used Typefaces at the top of the dropdown list somehting similar to how sketch and adobe handle this.
- Text - Line Height of options is all over the place. Not uniform.
- Text - Search in here is really fucking cool.
- Text - Chevron is missing on the Typeface dropdown
- Scroll - Wheel makes sense in a dev's head but, non-code person it may seem very odd or confusing.
- Scroll - Radius indivdual selector looks dope as fuck very nice
